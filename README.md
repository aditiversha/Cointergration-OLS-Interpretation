# Cointergration-OLS-Interpretation

## What is Cointegration?
A cointegration test is used to establish if there is a correlation between several time series in the long term. The concept was first introduced by Nobel laureates Robert Engle and Clive Granger, in 1987, after British economist Paul Newbold and Granger published the spurious regression concept.

Cointegration tests identify scenarios where two or more non-stationary time series are integrated together in a way that they cannot deviate from equilibrium in the long term. The tests are used to identify the degree of sensitivity of two variables to the same average price over a specified period of time.

## What is the ordinary Least square?
OLS or Ordinary Least Squares is a method used in Linear Regression for estimating the unknown parameters by creating a model which will minimize the sum of the squared errors between the observed data and the predicted one.

Ordinary Least Squares method works for both univariate dataset which means single independent variables and single dependent variables and multi-variate dataset which contains a single independent variable set and multiple dependent variables sets. Ordinary Least Squares method requires a machine learning algorithm called “Gradient Descent”.
